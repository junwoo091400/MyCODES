Still work in progress.

Apparently, twitter is not happy if I send too much tweets(status update) in a short period of time.

Also, this program, when re-ran, will try to upload same content again. Which will be rejected.

So,,,, probably a checklist system would be required(to only send NEW, un-Sent Tweets.)
